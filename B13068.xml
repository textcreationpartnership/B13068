         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And to that end alſo Our noble Progenitors haue beene at charge to erect and maintaine certaine Coynage houſes in ſeuerall Townes within Our Counties of <hi>Deuon</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> lying moſt commodious for the ſaid Coynage, with Ballances and Weights there, and Officers and Miniſters attending that ſeruice. At which places at certaine dayes of Coynage and poſt-Coynage appointed, ſpeciall Officers of the Stannaries doe, and haue beene wont duely to attend, to receiue, try, aſſay, peyze, coyne, ſeale and allow the ſaid Tynne, by ſetting a Marke, Seale, or Stampe vpon the ſame.</p>
            <p>By which meanes both Wee and Our Progenitors were ſecured of the emption or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption and Coynage duties of the ſaid Tynne, being ancient and vndoubted hereditarie

            <p>And whereas out of a Princely care to cheriſh and maintaine the Trade and Working of ſuch a worthie and Staple Commoditie, of ſo much honour and profit to this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, Our deare Father (of bleſſed memorie) did not long ſince take order to allow a greater price for the working and making thereof then euer was giuen before, which We haue hither-vnto continued.</p>
            <p>And Our ſaid late Father in His life time by ſad aduice, did ſettle the Tynne buſineſſe in a more orderly and better courſe then euer before it was, aſwell for the benefit of Vs, being then Prince, as for the contentment and ſatisfaction of Our louing Subiects, the Merchants and Pewterers of <hi>London</hi> and other places.</p>
            <p>Yet neuertheleſſe We are informed, That by the ſecret practice and combination of ſundry ill minded and couetous owners and workemen of the ſaid Tynne and Tynne works, a great part of the ſaid Tynne hath beene heeretofore, and daily is bought and ſold, receiued, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and carried away vncoyned, aſwell in Ships and other Veſſells, which vnder colour of comming to buy Corniſh Slate and Stone and ſuch like occaſions, vpon the coaſt of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> doe imbezill much vncoyned Tynne in Blockes, as alſo by Mariners and Seafaring men, who buy vp the Tynne in Barres, commonly called, Pocket Tynne, of Blowers and Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Tynne and others, contrary to the ancient Ordinances of Our Stannaries aforeſaid, to Our preiudice and wrong in Our ſaid Reuenue, and the diſgracing of Our ſaid Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie and abuſe of Our Subiects buying the ſame vntryed and not aſſayed.</p>

            <p>And whereas Wee are giuen to vnderſtand, that there are certaine wandring Pettie-Chapmen, and Tinkers and others haunting much about the Tynne workes and places of melting of Tynne, who doe make it a vſuall Trade to buy and barter Blacke Tynne by the Bowle, and White Tynne vncoyned by the pound weight, or other ſmall quantitie, and ſo doe carry the ſame from the ſaid places, to certaine priuate places of receipt, till hauing gotten by this vnlawfull meanes ſome ſtore together, they vent or ſpend the ſaid Blacke Tynne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be blowne, and ſell the ſaid White Tynne before it be Coyned, by ſea or by land where they finde beſt Chapmen, to the preiudice of Vs and Our louing Subiects as aforeſaid:</p>
            <p>Our will and pleaſure is, and Wee ſtraitely charge and command all and ſinguler Our Iuſtices of Peace, and all the Officers and Miniſters of the Stannaries, and others whom it ſhall or may concerne, before whom any ſuch Tinker, Pettie-Chapman, or other perſon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending ſhall bee brought, diligently to examine and finde out, where, and of whom hee had the ſaid prohibited Tynne White or Blacke found with him, and where and to whom hee meant or intended to ſell the ſame, or hath heeretofore ſold any other of like ſort: And aſwell the ſaid Tinkers and Pettie-Chapmen, as all other perſons who ſhall bee found priuie to the buying or ſelling, receiuing, deliuering, or bartering of the ſaid Tynne Blacke or White, as aforeſaid, to commit to Our Gaole of the Stannarie of that Countie where they ſhall bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and otherwiſe to puniſh them according to the Lawes, Cuſtomes, and Ordinances of Our Stannaries, as the qualitie and nature of the offence ſhall by the Lawes and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of this Realme deſerue, and for contempt of Our Royall Commandement and Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in this behalfe.</p>
